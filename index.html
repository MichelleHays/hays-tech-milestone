 <h1> Important Tech Milestones </h1>
      <h4> Michelle Hays </h4>
      <!-- First invention -->
       <h3> The World Brain </h3>
      <p> The World Brain was created by <b>H.G. Wells</b> in 1934. 
      It's the first invention to use hyperlinks like the ones used in modern technology. 
      <br>
      It is a collection of essays and addresses. It was a massive search engine, with well over 15 millions entries. 
      <br>
      Also referred to as the World Encyclopedia, Wells wanted it to be free and considered it his contribution 
      <br>
      to world peace. He was inspired around the time of the first world war, feeling that people needed to be more educated.
      <br> 
        His invention paved the way for hyperlinks and modern day information accessibility.

  <h3> The Z3 Computer </h3>
  <p> In 1935, <b>Konrad Zuse</b> began designing the Z3 computer, completing the task in 1941. The Z3 computer is considered
    <br>
     to be the first automatic digital computer. The computer's program code was stored on punched film, and initial values were
     <br>
     put in manually. Unfortunatley, the computer was destroyed on December 21, 1943. A replica of the Z3 computer was later built
     <br>
     in 1961, and is displayed in a museum. This invention was a stepping stone towards more modern computers, which is why Zuse is 
     <br>
     often credited with having invented the computer.

<h3> The Atanasoff-Berry Computer </h3>
  <p> The Atanasoff-Berry Computer is the first <em>electronic</em> computer. Professor John Vincent Atanasoff receives funds in 1939, 
    <br>
    planning to create this computer at what was Iowa State College at the time. The machine was completed in 1942 by Atanasoff and a partner. 
    <br>
    A legal battle over the patent for the invention of the computer was brought about, and later solved in 1973. What's important about this 
    <br>
    battle, and it's revolution, was that computers were agreed to be unpatentable. This means that computers can be created and profited by freely 
    <br>
    by anyone who wanted to create one. This made the computers advancement everyone's ability.

<h3> A Logic Named Joe</h3>
<p> In 1946, <b>Will F, Jenkins'</b> <i>A Logic Named Joe</i> was published in an issue of <i>Astounding Science Fiction</i>. Jenkins' book captured 
  <br>
  the capabilities of computers. An impressive science fiction, it follows the story of "logics" which are computer-like devices. Although much ahead 
  <br>
  of it's time, this book successfully predicted the massive networks of personal computers, and the ability to search for information, including their 
  <br>
  drawbacks, like people finding information that was supposed to be secret. With the understanding of the technology in Jenkin's book, it can be said 
  <br>
  that he was the first to have the idea of a massive network, and likeley paved the way for it to be made.

  <h3> The Manchester Baby </h3>
  <p> On June 21, 1948, the Small-Scale Experimental Machine (SSEM), created by researchers at the University of Manchester, ran it's first program. 
  <br>
    It's inventors, Frederic Williams, Tom Kilburn, and Geoff Toothill, intended for the machine not to be a practical computer, but instead was made to 
  <br>
    test a new memory technology, the Williams tube. Though primitive, it was the first working machine to contain all essential elements of a modern computer. 
<br>
    It was very important to the development in the modern day computer, and the development of memory.
